August UPDATE:
Still working on this one.  Eventually I'd like for the right side to cross over the left image, halfway across that image, then eventually having part of the image stack on top of the right container, as seen in a lot of the submissions.  I'm not sure if that will be covered in future lessons, but at least for now, I can try to make a few more flex adjustments.

I will be coming back to this project as well, to do the JS validations, as it was noted in previous lessons that the validations will be taught in later lessons.

August UPDATE #2:
Still haven't quite figured out the image/right container crossover. I decided just to work on the media section, and for the most part, I completed what I wanted to do with that.

Still a few things to figure out: The image credit to be more responsive and adjust when the right container will cross over, as well as maybe some more responsiveness with the right text margins.

August UPDATE #3:
Added another screen width... Still cant quite get the image to do what I want it to... Same goes for the credit and making it more responsive...
