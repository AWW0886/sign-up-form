August UPDATE:
Still working on this one.  Eventually I'd like for the right side to cross over the left image, halfway across that image, then eventually having part of the image stack on top of the right container, as seen in a lot of the submissions.  I'm not sure if that will be covered in future lessons, but at least for now, I can try to make a few more flex adjustments.

I will be coming back to this project as well, to do the JS validations, as it was noted in previous lessons that the validations will be taught in later lessons.
